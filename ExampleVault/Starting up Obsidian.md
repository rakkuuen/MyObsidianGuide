# Summary
Hello this is a basic cheat sheet for me to look at if I forget how to do stuff in obsidian and Markdown. Yeah. This is a good use of my free will.
# Initial Obsidian Customisation
This section will all be in the settings.
## Language and spellcheck
I am Australian. 
Thus, under **General**:
- I set my language as *English(GB)*.
Under **Editor**:
- I set my spellcheck languages as *English(Australia)* and remove the other.

If you are not from Australia then... don't do that... and change them to the relevant languages... cool.
## Themes
So the theme is essentially a CSS file that is placed into the *.obsidian* folder that is made when your vault is created. 
You can manage your themes under **Appearances** and then either:
- Load a custom one from your *file directory* 
	**OR** 
- Click *Manage* and download one from the open source library
