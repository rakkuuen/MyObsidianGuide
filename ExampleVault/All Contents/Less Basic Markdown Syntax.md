# Tables
You can insert a table in many different ways. The most important to me are:
- Right click and select *Insert table*
- Click *CTRL + p* and type/select *insert table*
## Example

| Name   | Age | Shortcomings as a human and friend                                | Favourite Colour |
| ------ | --- | ----------------------------------------------------------------- | ---------------- |
| Bob Ob | 53  | Forgot to buy presents for all of my friends birthdays this year. | Pink             |
You can add columns or rows by hovering the mouse near the edge of the table.
