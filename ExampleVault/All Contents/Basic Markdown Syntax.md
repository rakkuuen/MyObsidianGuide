#Syntax #Markdown
These are the most common md syntax used by specifically me...
# Headings
The following are headings:
# Heading 1
## Heading 2
### Heading 3

The Syntax for the above is:
## Syntax
\# Heading 1 
\## Heading 2
\### Heading 3

# Text format
**Bold**  \== \*\*Bold** 
*Italics* \== \*Italics* 
\ == Cancels out special identifier
	 E.g., This is how you can see the "\*\*" & "\*" identifiers in the right text above 
	 
# Lists
\- 
**OR**
1.
Will automatically start a list when there is a space to the right of them.
## Examples
### Unordered list
- Bing
- Bang
- Bong
### Ordered list
1. Wake up
2. Get out of bed
3. Make the bed
4. Question life
5. Go back to bed

# Block Quotes

## Result
> This is a block quote.

**OR**

> This 
> is 
> a 
> multi-line 
> block 
> quote

# Code Blocks
## Identifier
**Single line** 
\` code in here \`

**Multi- line** 
\`\`\`
code 
in
here
\`\`\`
## Result
`System.out.println("I love printing things yay");`
**OR**
```
public void WhoAmI(String name){
	System.out.println("I am " + name);
}
```


# Horizontal Rule
## Identifier
\-\-\-
## Result
---
Looks fancy


# Links
This is a super basic rundown of links there is a lot more that you can do and I will leave a **LINK** here so you can look if you want (you know staying in theme and all).
[A link to more info on links so you can make more links on info about links](https://help.obsidian.md/links)
## Identifiers
### Internal link
\[\[Filename]]
**OR**
\[\[Filename|Title]]
### External link
\[Title](www.example.com)

## Results
These both take you to the same internal file but the second one is named by me:
[[A File]]
[[A File|New Phone who dis?]]

This is an external link:
[Google](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dQw4w9WgXcQ)

# Images
I will show how to just paste an image below.
## Identifier
\!\[internalName]\(Image.webp)

## Example
![OBJECTION](Objection!_HD.webp)

## IMPORTANT INFORMATION
I would recommend getting a community plugin for image formatting to make life easier.
The Obsidian recommended image optimisation tool can be found [here.](https://help.obsidian.md/publish/media#Images)
This would require you to turn on third party plugins so look at what you are downloading and be safe friends. 
**Otherwise** 
If you hate yourself and like to waste time a lot then you can manually optimise as per the link [here.](https://help.obsidian.md/embeds#Embed+an+image+in+a+note)
